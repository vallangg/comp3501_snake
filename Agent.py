# TODO: I we need to figure out what exactly we need from the snake game to give to the agent
## I personally think a list of the locations of the snake segments as well as the location of the food, but looking online I have seen either feeding the whole frame into the agent
# i think this is pretty costly computation wise. I have also seen people give the snake a certain amount of vision. We should talk to Hutt about it
# TODO add more commenting and the preamble
